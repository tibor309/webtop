## Setup
To use this desktop, change the docker image tag to `ubuntu`. For setup options, go back to the [main page][setup].

> [!NOTE]
> * The GNOME desktop environment is a bit unstable in this configuration.
> * Ubuntu's custom themes are not applied correctly. You can fix this, by creating your own gtk3 and gtk4 configs.
